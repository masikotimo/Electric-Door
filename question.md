Question:

In a company where security is paramount, access to given rooms through stored passwords. When one needs access that room, they are required to enter a password/code (5 digits). To access the room you are given utmost three chances. If you enter three wrong passwords, the alarm sounds for 5 seconds and then the system is locked.  When the system is locked, only the administrator can unlock it. This is by entering a certain code (5 digits). When the system is locked, the LCD should read system locked. Before the system is unlocked, no password will be accepted until it is unlocked. When one provides the right password, the door will be open for use to them for a period of 2 minutes. During this time, the led light is on. A seven segment display is available to showing a count down from 2 minutes to 0 and when it hits 0, an alarm is sounded for 1 second and a message “Enter access code” printed on the LCD. After this, another person can enter a password/code to access the room. The system should have a record of how many people have successfully accessed the room at a certain time. You can use a dc motor to simulate the door opening.
